# Introduction

In this project, we provide an explainable end-to-end Tactics an Techniques classification framework, which can identify and extract semantic evidence from Cyber Threat Intelligence without human experince.

We provide the dataset, the models and layers (and python wheel), and of course the pretrained models of the framework.

You can follow the `./trainFastText.ipynb`, a jupyter notebook to get the start.
